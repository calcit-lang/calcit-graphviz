## Triadica

> render DOT file that can be handled by Graphviz

Triadica is now a pure Calcit DOT source generator. The former native
`render-dot-file` bridge was an unimplemented `"TODO"` stub and was retired;
use `triadica.core/digraph`, `graph`, `node`, `arrow`, and `connect` directly.

### Usages
